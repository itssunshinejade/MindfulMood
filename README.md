# MindfulMood

MindTrack is an integrated health management system that helps individuals maintain both mental and physical well-being with a single, user-friendly, console-based platform. 
It allows users to log their daily moods, stress levels, and self-care activities while tracking vital signs, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and blood sugar. Therapists and physicians can securely access this data to monitor progress, deliver targeted feedback, and offer personalized recommendations. Overall, MindTrack supports a balanced approach to health by showing how mental and physical wellness are connected and by encouraging regular self-checks and communication between patients and healthcare providers.
